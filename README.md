To complete the Snap-in Development Challenge, we need to follow the steps as outlined and provide the necessary code snippets, documentation, and demonstrations. Here's the full solution in the required format:

### Step 1 (10 points): Utilizing the DevRev API

#### Task: Create a Work Item

Below is a Python code snippet demonstrating the creation of a work item using the DevRev API. This assumes you have the necessary API token and endpoint URL.

python
```bash
import requests

### Replace with your DevRev API token and endpoint URL

API_TOKEN = 'your_api_token_here'
API_URL = 'https://api.devrev.ai/v1/work_items'

headers = {
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {API_TOKEN}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}

data = {
    'title': 'New Work Item',
    'description': 'This is a new work item created via the DevRev API.',
    'type': 'issue',  # Example type
    'priority': 'medium'
}

response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=data)

if response.status_code == 201:
    print('Work item created successfully:', response.json())
else:
    print('Failed to create work item:', response.text)
```


### Step 2 (30 points): Creating a Snap-in

#### Task: Create and Install a Snap-in

For this challenge, we will implement the following snap-ins:

1. *Command to clone a work item (issue/ticket).*
2. *Auto-Reply to a message if it is outside office hours.*

## Submission Guideline

1. **Repository Link:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/indiragothi/DevRev-Snap-In-Development-Challenge)

2. **Documentation:**
   - *Step 1:*
     - [Code Snippet for Creating a Work Item](#Step-1-10-points-Utilizing-the-DevRev-API)
   - *Step 2:*
     - **Clone Work Item Snap-in:**
       - [Manifest and Handler Script](#Snap-in-1-Clone-a-Work-Item)
       - [Instructions and Screenshot](#Instructions-to-Install-and-Use-the-Snap-in)
     - **Auto-Reply Snap-in:**

       - [Instructions and Screenshot](#Instructions-to-Install-and-Use-the-Snap-in-1)

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Accuracy and completeness of implementation:** The provided code snippets and scripts should work correctly and fulfill the requirements.
- **Clarity and organization of documentation:** The documentation should be clear, organized, and easy to follow.
- **Creativity and innovation in solving the challenges:** The implementation should be creative and solve the given problems efficiently.
- **Adherence to best practices in programming and snap-in development:** The code should follow best practices, be well-structured, and maintainable.
